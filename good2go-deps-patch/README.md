# Good2Go – Missing deps fix (lucide-react, chart.js)

Your Vercel build failed because `lucide-react` and `chart.js` are not installed.

## Option A — Quick install (preferred)
Edit **package.json** and add these to `"dependencies"` (exact versions are fine to copy):

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "chart.js": "^4.4.3",
    "lucide-react": "^0.468.0"
  }
}
```

Then run locally (or let Vercel pick them up after commit/push):
```bash
npm install
git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "Add chart.js and lucide-react"
git push
```

## Option B — Use this component
If you want to keep the `OutcomesChart.tsx` shown in the design, drop the file from this ZIP into:
`components/OutcomesChart.tsx`

It is a **client component** and uses `chart.js/auto`. No extra types needed.

## Notes
- Ensure any icon usage imports from `lucide-react`, e.g.
  ```ts
  import { CalendarCheck, Sparkles, Menu } from "lucide-react";
  ```
- If you used `data-lucide` HTML attributes from the CDN example, convert those to `lucide-react` components in JSX.

After committing, redeploy on Vercel.
