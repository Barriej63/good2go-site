# Good2Go: react-chartjs-2 Patch

This patch replaces the manual `<canvas>` chart with a `react-chartjs-2` component and ensures imports point to the **components** folder (not the staging folder).

## What to do

1. **Copy** `components/OutcomesChart.tsx` from this zip into your repo at:
   `./components/OutcomesChart.tsx` (overwrite if asked).

2. **Update imports** anywhere you use the chart to:
   ```ts
   import OutcomesChart from '@/components/OutcomesChart';
   ```
   or (without the alias) `../components/OutcomesChart` depending on your file location.

3. **Delete the staging file** so it can’t be picked up by mistake:
   `./good2go-deps-fix/OutcomesChart.tsx` (and any similar copies).

4. Ensure your `/package.json` includes (you already added these, but double-check):
   ```json
   "react-chartjs-2": "^5.2.0",
   "chart.js": "^4.4.4"
   ```

5. Commit to `main`, then in Vercel hit **Redeploy** and **uncheck** “Use existing Build Cache”.

That’s it. The build should pass without TypeScript canvas typings.
