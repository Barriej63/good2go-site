# Good2Go Website Sections Patch

Adds the following pages to your Next.js App Router site:
- `/about`
- `/features` (replaces with structured cards)
- `/how-it-works`
- `/evidence`  (also available at `/scientific-foundation`)

Also updates `components/Header.tsx` with navigation links to these pages.

## Install
1) Copy the `app/` and `components/` folders from this zip into your repo (merge/overwrite files).
2) Commit to `main` and redeploy (uncheck "Use existing Build Cache").

All files use inline styles to avoid any Tailwind setup issues.
